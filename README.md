Android Wifi setup test(change SSID)

For some phones(Samsung Galaxy S6 edage, Android 6.0), switch WiFi between home WiFi and Soft AP, 

sometimes can't connect back to home Wifi(frequency 1/10), so write a test programe to verify this issue.

To improve connect back home WiFi, we try to connect again if failed, it works almost every time after do reconnection.
